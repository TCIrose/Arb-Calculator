A python application utilizing the tkinter GUI.
Applications main purpose is to make it easier to calculate arbritrage bets.
That includes; the stakes, outcome and potential profits/losses.
It does come with a commision entry for bookmakers, which i found quite wanting in most if not all arbitrage calculators that only include the entry for exchange sites only.
This software is up for more community input. Fork me for more on that.
